            <p>Hello, my name is Jack Wasylenko. I have been an supporter of the Calgary Flames Professional Hockey Club since the 2005-2006 season. I always had an affliction for the NHL. Specifically the Flames, albeit they haven't always iced a premier product in my youth. I strictly remeber the team rebuilding while I was attending Henry Wise Wood Senior High School in southwest Calgary. They suprising made the playoffs in my senior year thanks in part largely to a dominant first line (elite rookie), good goaltending, and an attention to detail on defense. The team were termed the "cardiac kids" and frequently stormed back to tie and win games in the final period of play. I see some parallels to this club in modern day, and the team constructed by Brad Treliving during the 2014-15 NHL season.</p>
            <p>In this website I will break down four home hockey games the Flames played in a 19 day-span this November. That will be November 3rd, 2024 vs the Edmonton Oilers, November 15th, 2024 vs the Nashville Predators, November 19th, 2024 vs the New York Islanders,and finally November 21st, 2024 vs the New York Rangers. All games took place at the Scotiabank Saddledome in Calgary.</p>
